## Description 

This is a to-do list application that allows a user to add and remove list items, as well as mark items as complete or incomplete. The complete/incomplete status of items persist in MySQL database. 

When the user opens the application, the to-do list items will be rendered on the page as either completed or incomplete. Each item has a button that allows the user to delete the item as well as a button that toggles the to-do item as completed or incomplete. A form at the bottom of the page allows the user to type and save a new item, which renders on the page immediately in the incomplete column by default. 

The application is structured with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and makes use of Express Handlebars and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to organize the codebase.
